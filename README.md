Bookmark Manager
----------------

Week 4 Makers Academy project.

The task is to create a bookmark manager - a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.
